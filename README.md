Sure! Below is a sample README.md file for the Python code that generates a weekly meal plan with randomized vegetarian and non-vegetarian options:

Weekly Meal Plan Generator
This Python script generates a weekly meal plan with randomized options for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. It reads meal options from a file, shuffles them, and then selects one meal plan for each day of the week (Monday to Sunday). The meal plans rotate every week, providing a variety of meal options throughout the month.

Features
Randomly generates meal plans for each day of the week.
Includes options for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals.
Organizes meals into breakfast, lunch, and dinner categories.
Uses ANSI escape codes for terminal colors to distinguish between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Python script (weekly_meal_plan.py) directly.

Ensure you have the foodTimeTable/all_food.txt file in the same directory as the script. This file contains the meal options in the following format:
